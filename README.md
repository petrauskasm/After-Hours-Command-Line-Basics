AFTER-HOURS COMMAND LINE BASICS

Why use the Command Line?

The command line was one of the first interfaces through which people could dynamically interact with computers.
In the 70's and early 80's, it was essentially the only way to interact with mainframe and proto-desktop computers.
Even today, all operating systems support command line interfaces of some sort.

Given how sleek modern operating systems are (i.e. with mice, touch screens, and 3D-accelerated application windows),
this begs the question: why do we still need command lines? The answer is that command lines are powerful. For many
tasks, they are faster and less error prone than alternative interfaces that rely on windows, mice, clicking, tapping, etc.
Further, command lines are ideal for automation. It is trivially easy to automate and systematize repetitive tasks using a
command line; tasks that would otherwise be monotonous and time consuming. Lastly, command lines are ideal for accessing and
controlling computers remotely. In an age of cloud computing, the need to remotely administer resources is greater than ever.
In summary: command lines are not a useless relic from computing history; they are a vital and powerful tool of the present.
